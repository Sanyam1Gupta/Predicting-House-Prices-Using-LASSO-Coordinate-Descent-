# Predicting House Prices Using LASSO (Coordinate-Descent)

This project predicts the house sales price using LASSO implemented cyclical coordinate descent.LASSO performs L1 regularization, i.e. adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients
and after this achieves the Minimization objective.(This mini-project is a part of ML specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
